# Stack_Overflow_Survey

This is my first notebook project using python and jupyter notebooks to analyze data from the Stack Overflow annual developer survey. My goal was to familiarize myself with python code, specifically pandas and matplotlib. The .csv fil included is not the full survey results, just a filtered version that focuses on respondents from the United States and just the questions I was most interested in looking at. The responses included werethe respondents' age, salary, coding languages worked with and data bases worked with. 

There are a few plots included already and I am currently working on creating new ones to compare the resot of the data.
